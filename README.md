## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

Through this project, I refined my understanding of mobile-first workflow and responsive design. It was also a great practice in using CSS Flexbox for layout and working with CSS custom properties to streamline color and typography settings.

Here’s a code snippet I’m proud of, which efficiently centers the card component both horizontally and vertically:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
